A program used to calculate the Offered Traffic Load, the Concluded Traffic Load, the Lost Traffic Load and the Grade of
Service; with given inputs the number of calls, missed calls and the duration of the calls made for a call center
(telephone exchange center). Used libraries are Pandas, CSV and Plotly Express. As an output, the program creates a CSV
file including the Grade of Service as a percentage in the first column and the Concluded Traffic Load in the second,
it also creates a data visualization of the CSV file, generating a plot with the GoS as a function of the Concluded
Load, with the X-axis being said load and the Y-axis the GoS respectively.
