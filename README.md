A program used to calculate the Grade of Service and Quality of Service of a Telecommunication Network with two given
inputs; the number of service lines and traffic load respectively, inserted in the Erlang B recursive formula and as a
result, it extracts the overall call blockage and performance, both expressed as a probability and then as a percentage.
With the help of the pandas library, it is also able to create an MS Excel file named 'erlang.xlsx' which includes a
table with four columns and a dynamic multitude of rows which can be defined by how many inputs are given.

This project is helpful for those who may have to check how successful a Telecommunication Network can be, by simply
typing in two inputs.
